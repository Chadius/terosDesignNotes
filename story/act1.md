## 120: Vale swoops in

What is it? Vale swoops in to rescue Teros from a bandit

Why is it important? Vale introduces herself. She's proud of her strength and power, boistrous and enjoys scaring lesser foes.

What happens next? Vale is also aggressive, too caught up in battle to help Teros with his own troubles.

---

A blast of lightning streaks out and knocks the archer right off the rooftop. The other archer corrects her aim and fires at the threat. A static field burns the arrow before it strikes the elder pale skinned woman. She floats down and rests on her wooden staff.

"**Teros, what are you waiting for?**" She glares at him. "**Stop playing with your food.**" She notices the blood from his shoulder. "**Don't tell me you've been stomping bandits this entire year.**"

Teros hesitates. His memory takes a moment to activate. "**Ah. Vale! Good to see you again.**" He keeps his spear trained on Fracta while tilting his head to the side. "**Sorry, maybe we can talk after dispatching these brigands?**"

Vale calls the winds and lifts herself. "**Sure.**" She grins at the archer and fries another arrow inches from her torso. "**I'll handle the small fry. You can go after Queenie here.**"

The archer takes a step back and looks for the archway, hoping the wind propels her to safety. Vale takes off like a hyena on the hunt, tiring out her prey.

Teros focuses on the remaining threat. Fracta just wipes her face with the palm of her hand. "**Alright, now that the distraction. Let's try this again. The herbs. Your life. Deal?**"

## 750: Teros confesses

What is it?

Why is it important?

What happens next? 

When teros confesses his identity, everyone has a reason to stay and continue following his commands:

- For Vale, she just wants a memory of her good friend to return, even if he's not the real deal she witnesses much of the former captain's personality in the new captain, and it's like a memory of an old friend she can hold on to. 

- Gloria sees Teros as a peacekeeper, trying to ensure stability in Godsfont. And so she will follow his orders as sub commander.

- Lini is primarily here to rescue the people of Godsfont. And also she owes Teros her life. That is a debt that she will repay in one way or another. This might be the the action that does it. 

- Fracta is here to destroy her old band. And also she will be punished if she tries to flee. So she's sticking around.

- Ingenue is just excited by this new twist. It's yet another reason for her to stick around and dig up more about Godsfont's secrets and mysteries. 

- Mek is here to rescue the people who have been kidnapped. He does not care who he rescues it with.

- Surge who does not trust teros but he's the lesser evil compared to Barubary. And if Godsfont really is in trouble, then he will step in where he is needed.

# Final

What is it? Teros leads the Guard against Barubary.

Why is it important? The finale takes down the big bad and cements Teros as a hero.

What happens next? Teros earns the trust of many, including the begrudging respect of Surge.
