# Pelatin Merchant Family

This family of humans and fire djinn have been merchants for centuries, descending from the first merchants who brought outside goods to Virton's War Front.

Their tools became incredibly rare and highly valued. The secrets to create and use them made them powerful and connected. They know of Vale's storm wall and do not like it.

# Polann Workers Union

Mostly Earth Djinn who repair the wall get little pay, and little respect outside of their neighborhood. They want outsiders to understand who they are.
