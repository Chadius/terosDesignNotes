## Managing this folder
Type in here until it's too big, and THEN split it off into subfolders.

# RNG abuse or no?
Give an option to have the RNG deterministic (so it can be manipulated)
or it constantly changes (so you can't cheat.)
## Saving for replays
Replays should always store the results of each action, including the dice
roll results.
# Draft race mode
## Ratio draft
Squaddies are scored between 1 and 5. The more points, the more useful the squaddie.
Then the player gets a score limit to make a team.

Because I don't want to stick my opinion on this (seriously, I can't keep up with that.)
Just start at 3 and let the players change the ratio.

# Counter Agent mode
Player 1 plays the Godsfont Guard, tries to complete missions
Player 2 controls the enemy army, tries to force mission failure
## Incentives to avoid stalemates
It's very easy for both armies to just build up forces and then wait
for the player to get impatient.
### For the player - Periodic buffs
Surviving players get +1 to all of their stats every few turns.
This can snowball very quickly and make them basically invincible.
### For the enemy - Hard Turn Limit
The player forcibly loses after a certain number of turns.
So if the enemy can stall for long enough, they'll win.
### For the enemy - Smart Bomb
The enemy boss can use a powerful attack that hits all players, 
based on how close they are to the boss.

Enemy bosses can run up to players and use this bomb to break stalemates.
