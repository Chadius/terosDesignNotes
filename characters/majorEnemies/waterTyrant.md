#​ What lie does she live?
The desert should acknowledge my aid to their survival.
I deserve their thanks. Now I demand their worship.
# Backstory
The Corruption infused Torrin’s body and copied her mind, but it could not take her soul. Torrin broke free and escaped to recuperate, but the Corruption took what was left. Unlike the original Torrin, the Corruption had no fear, and set out to fulfill every desire Torrin held back.

She formed an idealized humanoid body, flaunting her beauty. She tapped deep into the Thirst to entice and seduce others to her bidding. She controlled the Waterbed and used it to destroy villages and tribes by starving them out. The ones she spared gave her soldiers as mercenaries and toys. She was a Tyrant, everything the original Torrin feared.

But what ruler was complete without a castle? She constructed an underground castle out of sand and water, beautiful and alluring like her. The Thirst was strongest here, among the exposed waterbed. Her soldiers enjoyed their dreams and followed her will. Any with second thoughts either drowned or watched the room collapse on them. She demanded loyalty and entertainment, and they gave her both.

Her only obligation was the Original Teros. His orders were absolute. Her mission was to create new life using the waterbed and corruption. She created facsimiles of demons for him. Mindless beasts who lived only to kill. Teros saw the strength but he demanded humanoid creatures. Ones who could blend in easily like Teros. Her first attempt was Bleud, which he deemed a failure. She stays in the castle indulging herself and waiting for more orders. Meanwhile, Barubary continues his efforts to capture more research subjects.

Now that Barubary is dead, the Tyrant can conquer Godsfont. She finds Simulacrum Teros too tempting to pass on, and she plans to starve Godsfont to bait him out. She will live with him forever, while the rest of Godsfont will be a present to original Teros.

#​ Body, Copied Mind but no Soul
Torrin’s fluidity had her broken down into a body, mind and soul aspect.

The Body is the easiest to copy, as it was all physical. Enhancing it was easy as well, as it wants to be “Perfected.”

The Mind was copied, all of her memories before the corruption is intact.

# Failed Redemption Arc Trifecta
##​ Starting out
###​ What is at personal stake?
Freedom to take whatever she wants.
###​ How does she view herself?
Never gets to choose her destiny, it always seems like she has to follow someone else’s edict.
###​ How does she view the world?
The world owes her for saving it.
She should be unrestrained from societal expectations.
##​ How does it change?
###​ What is at personal stake?
###​ How does she view herself?
###​ How does she view the world?
###​ What choice can she make to demonstrate her change?
Near the finale, she tries to convince Teros to come to her side. She recalls a passionate evening with Teros, infusing him with oxygenated water as they embraced. She didn’t have to pretend to be human, she could just be herself.

Teros admits it is a lovely memory. But their warmest memory was when Surge read them a book he wrote. It was full of logical errors, lacked suspense, and Surge lost track of their names for a bit. But watching Surge’s determination impressed him. He and Torrin were proud their son was forging his own path, bound neither by tradition or nature.

Corrupt Torrin feels uncomfortable about her binding to her child, but Teros reassures her it was worth it. If she could relinquish control and let the original Torrin use her divine power, maybe the corruption can be removed and put her at peace.
##​ Why does she fail to redeem herself?
Corrupt Teros treats her as a science experiment and nothing else- she resents that.

Teros tries to convince her to reform, but ultimately she is sick and tired of being subservient to someone. She realizes Teros is merely trying to control her.

The original Torrin just wants her body back, to restrain, restrict and control.

She decides she can only be free to herself, and attacks the party as she sees them as captors. They even tricked the cloned Teros to become their slave.
#​ Tarot card challenge: Corrupt Torrin
Torrin and Corrupted Torrin share the same cards, but Corrupted Torrin is reversed.
## 18. The Moon (Reversed)
Finally free from mystery, Corrupt Torrin is able to do whatever she wants without restraint. She doesn’t need a divine voice to interrupt, nor societal pressure to follow tradition. She’s going to follow her gut. And if it doesn’t work? Too bad. 
##​ 21. The World (Upright)
Her duty is complete. The Corrupt Torrin feels she has done enough for the world, and it’s time she was allowed to indulge. Power is hers to claim, and she will take what she wants. After all, the world is her oyster to consume.
##​ 0. The Fool (Reversed)
Corrupted Torrin takes a lot of risks and makes sacrifices to enjoy herself. She’s suffered enough, it’s time for others to deal with it!

#​ Seven deadly sins flaw
## 2. Gluttony vs Temperance
Torrin sees the opportunity to indulge in her desires, and embraces it. With her power and influence over the army she can order her minions to satisfy her every desire and throw their lives away for her. She is tired of considering other people’s needs!

#​ Simulacrum Torrin’s Masks
## Physical
###​ External
Torrin’s body is attractive and fit. Well defined musculature, towering over the others, and a killer grin. She is a Water Djinn, but the corruption keeps all the water to herself.
###​ Internal
Without a Soul to balance her out, Torrin’s body went for an idealized form - at least according to Teros’s wishes.
##​ Mental
​### External
Torrin carries the lessons from her original self. The Corruption also augments her knowledge with the ability to create Simulacra and Demons, although she knows by instinct.
###​ Internal
Torrin prefers brute force, her charm and overwhelming force, in that order. She bullies people into getting what she wants, and she kills when they won’t give it up. She’s not much of a learner.
##​ Spiritual
###​ External
The original Torrin is a devout follower of good religions like Virton and Nirsi. But Torrin doesn’t care about that. She’s here to take: she wants a mate, she wants to rule, she wants to own her identity.
###​ Internal
Torrin knows she is an incomplete vessel. The body must be fed first before the mind or soul. Everyone should help her first.
###​ Core

#​ Relation to Player Characters
##​ Original Teros
He used to pay attention to her, asking for her status and capacity. She eventually realized he was measuring her utility to create, and nothing more. Once the Bleud experiment failed and Barubary was on the case, the man no longer paid attention to her. Her slaves fulfilled her every need, all but one: Teros.
##​ Teros
Simulacrum or not, this man was everything she remembered: caring, charming, accepting. And lonely, like her. He is perfect. Even better, the Original Teros has nothing to gain from keeping him. Like Bleud she will accept his refuse. Unlike Bleud, she will be quite glad to keep this one.
##​ Bleud
She never liked the plan. At best, Bleud stole Original Teros’s attention. At worst she’s a drain on resources. He should rely more on the Tyrant’s abilities, anyway.
