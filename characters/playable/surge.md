# Surge
Can’t deal with the death of 1 truth and the birth of another
Will his happy past turn into a deluding present? Can he accept that things have changed?
# Story
Son of Teros and Torrin, Surge is a Water Djinn who lives in Godsfont. To keep fend off prejudice, he focused on conversation and motivating others to trust him. His storytelling abilities served him well and he learned much about the world.
He was kidnapped along with his parents. He watched the corruption infect them and turn them into monsters. In a stroke of luck he was able to escape before he was exposed. The demons and Simulacra gave chase, and he learned the subtle clues he needed to detect their approach.
Teros rescues him from a demon patrol, but Surge sees through him, distrusting him and warning Vale of the threat he represents. His best chance to survive is to stay with the Godsfont Guard and prepare for Teros’s eventual betrayal.

### Spiritual
#### External
His mother Torrin was a devout worshipper of Virton, and believed in order and justice to overcome the greatest of evils. Whenever he was worried, she encouraged him to pray to Virton and seek peace.
Teros enjoyed protecting Godsfont almost as much as magical study. By learning more and more, he could reach his “perfect” self - capable of making no mistakes and feeling intellectually content.
#### Internal
Surge hates taking the limelight and believes that’s a waste of power. If you are truly right, and you are doing the correct thing, then people should willingly choose to follow you.

## Seven Deadly Sins and Virtue
### 2. Gluttony vs Temperance
Surge’s trust has always been at risk. He was never trusted fully in Godsfont, often called The Withheld. Teros was his father until the Simulacrum got to him. Potential allies turn out to be Simulacra out to capture him make it hard to trust anyone besides his godmother Vale.  He’s vulnerable to self-sabotage, to the point where Torrin and Vale worry he will become a hermit and isolate himself. Can he learn to give the benefit of a doubt?
