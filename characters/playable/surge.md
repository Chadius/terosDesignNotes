# Surge
Can’t deal with the death of 1 truth and the birth of another
Will his happy past turn into a deluding present? Can he accept that things have changed?
# Story
Son of Teros and Torrin, Surge is a Water Djinn who lives in Godsfont. To keep fend off prejudice, he focused on conversation and motivating others to trust him. His storytelling abilities served him well and he learned much about the world.
He was kidnapped along with his parents. He watched the corruption infect them and turn them into monsters. In a stroke of luck he was able to escape before he was exposed. The demons and Simulacra gave chase, and he learned the subtle clues he needed to detect their approach.
Teros rescues him from a demon patrol, but Surge sees through him, distrusting him and warning Vale of the threat he represents. His best chance to survive is to stay with the Godsfont Guard and prepare for Teros’s eventual betrayal.
# Personality
## Surge’s Masks
### Physical
#### External
The second water djinn in centuries, he is an adult in his early 40s. He has the look and maturity of a 22 year old human. White locks of hair fall to his waist.
#### Internal
Surge values his flute and his notebook more than anything. All of his creativity is expressed through sound or the written word, and he works to blend both.
### Mental
#### External
Torrin reminds him he represents the water, rain, and dew of the desert. He must understand how the weather works and to use water, the source of all life to help everyone.
Teros reminds him of the essence of magic and how it can be used to bend the rules of nature enough to get things to work in your favor.
#### Internal
Surge must deal with feelings of trust. He carefully judges those who help and looks for their ulterior motive. He will bring them into a crowd and observe how they act. At least they can’t betray everyone at once. He doesn’t offer his help unless he can see them in aciton.
### Spiritual
#### External
His mother Torrin was a devout worshipper of Virton, and believed in order and justice to overcome the greatest of evils. Whenever he was worried, she encouraged him to pray to Virton and seek peace.
Teros enjoyed protecting Godsfont almost as much as magical study. By learning more and more, he could reach his “perfect” self - capable of making no mistakes and feeling intellectually content.
#### Internal
Surge hates taking the limelight and believes that’s a waste of power. If you are truly right, and you are doing the correct thing, then people should willingly choose to follow you.

## Seven Deadly Sins and Virtue
### 2. Gluttony vs Temperance
Surge’s trust has always been at risk. He was never trusted fully in Godsfont, often called The Withheld. Teros was his father until the Simulacrum got to him. Potential allies turn out to be Simulacra out to capture him make it hard to trust anyone besides his godmother Vale.  He’s vulnerable to self-sabotage, to the point where Torrin and Vale worry he will become a hermit and isolate himself. Can he learn to give the benefit of a doubt?

## 2021-11-25
- Teros chooses to hide his shame and suffer suspicion.
- Vale holds onto a false hope, defying logic.
- Surge loses faith in Vale and distrusts Teros more.

"Vale, there you are." Surge approaches like a dog glad to see his master. As he turns the corner, he barely conceals his fangs. "Teros." Strategy had given way to an awkward pause.

"Surge, Teros and I were discussing tomorrow's raid. Come on." She waves the Undine over to the map. "Most of our troop will serve as a distraction. Draw the weaklings out. Our target is the leader, Korsin and his benefactor. Fracta said we take them out, she can retake control of the bandits and order them to surrender." She looks to Teros, he nods. She looks to Surge and his distaste is obvious to them both.

"R-right. How do we know they won't have a reserve troop?" Surge looks Teros right in the eye. "How do we know you haven't given us away? Maybe they're lying in ambush, right outside the camp." Quill forms into a shocked expression before hovering between the two.

Teros gently moves Quill aside. "Surge, my goal is to rescue the people they kidnapped. You know this. The easiest way is to disrupt their chain of command so we can secure the hostages in the ensuing chaos." His words slow, calculated for logic, ignorant of Surge's true questions. "And I am the Captain. Why would I jeopardize the mission?"

Surge's eyes scan over to Vale's. Her eyes are on the floor. "Vale, did you ever finish the analysis?" She looks up at him *not now*. He looks to Teros. "When you... rescued me from Barubary, you bled. I asked Vale to analyze your blood. I don't know who you are, exactly, but-"

Vale taps the ground with her wooden cane. "Okay Surge. The results were... inconclusive." Both look at her, she isn't looking back. "That's not true. The blood was a perfect match. Like he hadn't aged a day since we drew it last time." She keeps her gaze on the walls. Surge knew his Guardian all his life; she was hiding her suspicions with her trademark pacing routine. "So... it's him. It's Teros."

Surge sighed. "The last 2 people I met who claimed to be Teros were very manipulative. They relied on magic to twist my mind into compliance. They failed because they looked like him, but they couldn't act like him." He looks through Teros.

Teros cleared his throat. "Once again, I am sorry they targeted you like that. But I am him." *I must be him.* "I am Teros. Vale never told me about the blood test, how could I fake that?" Teros lifts the weight of his lies. Too many lives will be crushed underneath its weight.

"...Very well. I will travel with you if you want to the bandit camp." Surge turns away from the lies. "Good night, Vale." Surge moves away from his trust. This thing got to Vale, his Guardian. Maybe she was tired of searching. Maybe she was tired of failure. Maybe she didn't take his stories for granted. But Surge would not let anyone get to him again.
