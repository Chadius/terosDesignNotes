# Archetype
Honor above Duty; Gloria to her friends
Gloria refused to tell the truth without proof. That hesitation cost her everything. She overcompensates with direct confrontation.

# Backstory
Gloria comes from the other kingdom. She rejected the hand of a wealthy powerful businessman to continue her weapons training with her teammate, his brother. The duo rode out to investigate a sign of corruption, only for a demon to attack them. She slew the demon and survived, but her friend did not. The nobleman was furious and Gloria realized he was working with the demon in a bid for power.

Without any solid proof or evidence, Gloria keep quiet. The formal investigation covered everything up and she was discredited. The nobleman offered her a new duty – search for two errant arch mages in the middle of a desert. She was banished to a wild chase by the very person who needed her gone.

In Godsfont, Gloria joined the Godsfont Guard and became the Deputy Captain under Teros’s command. She is militant, professional, and strict. She also believes in exposing lies and confronting them immediately, even without proof. She doesn’t want anyone to suffer from inaction like she did. But sometimes people have incomplete information, or she’s putting them on the spot before they are ready- that’s a different problem.

## Godsfont’s number 2
Dame Gloria’s skill makes her quickly rise to the number two position.
When Teros left for a year-long sojourn she took over as head of the Godsfont Guard.
Dame Gloria maintained her old traditions, unable to adjust to the Godsfont way.
Soldiers never trusted her the same way they trusted Teros.

# What does she look like?
Gloria is foreign to this environment, so it’s alright if she looks like she’s a merge of two different cultures.

Give Gloria a short black ponytail. And a glorious cape!

## Anti look: Catherine from Fire Emblem 3 Houses
Short blonde hair, tanned skin, shiny white armor. Whoops, I subconsciously drew a popular character.

## Anti look: Boob armor
No. Please, no.

## Anti look: Tons of armor
She is used to being a knight, but she’s in a desert environment. Muh realism.

## Tarot Card Personality
### 6. Lovers
Dame Gloria had to choose between the Law of the land and the ability
  to do Good. She chose to do both, honoring the Vinland command and
  accepting exile- but she worries she made the wrong choice. Maybe 
   she should have remained and protected the people she could have.
Maybe she should have openly accused Derrick, even though she lacked
  evidence. The path not taken is a never ending worry.
### 18. Moon
Dame Gloria puts her fears aside and encourages others to prevail
  against adversity. She remembers her many struggles to prevail
  as a knight. She’s particularly proud of her knighthood. But
  these titles are eventually meaningless. Is she displacing her pride?
### 10. Wheel of Fortune
Dame Gloria enjoys her knighthood, and the struggle therein. She held a
  brave face as she was exiled, but she feels like she lost her life’s
  effort and work. She doesn’t want to burden others with her needs,
  so she keeps quiet. But it doesn’t hurt to ask for help.
There are many who are ready to repay the favor.

## Seven Deadly Sins Personality
### 6. Envy vs Gratitude
Dame Gloria had to work every day of her life to achieve her riches
  and title. Meanwhile, Derrick Vinland and other nobles get ahead
  by birth. She envies the gifts they received, and wishes they
  didn’t waste them so readily.

Dame Gloria never thinks about the opportunities she has had and how
  fortunate she is to get to where she is. A little self reflection 
  goes a long way.
