# Ingénue
Seeks the truth, but she’s blind to her own bias
A street smart reporter, Ingénue is quick to force the truth out of other people. But she is blind to her own personal bias, filtering what she wants to hear rather than what she needs to hear.

## Name significance
Ingénue is used to refer to an innocent, naive woman. Usually in plays, musicals and works of art.
### Pronunciation guide
It’s French. Awn-jzah-new is the closest I can get.
# Story
Ingénue is a wind djinn reporter. Her nomadic clan carries rumors on the wind. Even as a child, the wind wall fascinated her. Who locked them in here? What experiences is she denied? She focused her investigation on Vale and traveled to Godsfont.
Banditry, homelessness and inequality – she saw Godsfont’s flaws and bias. But she always sees flaws first, and never sees it in herself. She mocks the Fractal Bandits outside of Godsfont and finds quite a scoop: They plan to assault the town. She knows too much, and is captured. Teros rescues her from execution. She has an even bigger scoop – the Godsfont Guard Captain and Vale right behind him.
Ingénue sticks around so she can get to the bottom of the Godsfont conspiracy.

# Personality
## What is Ingénue’s mask?
Ingénue feels resentful that she’s imprisoned in this desert. Even if it’s for “her own safety”, she wants the freedom to determine if it’s safe enough, and someone stealing her choice is her button, and she doesn’t handle it well.

## Ingénue’s Layers
### Physical - What does she look like? How does she present herself?
#### External
She’s overweight, probably obese, skin is pale white with sand for hair. Two of her arms are sleeveless, with shiny metal bracelets. Her wing arms wrap around her neck and collarbone, resembling a scarf.

She’s big, and she knows it. She knows people don’t like her size. She doesn’t care. When the wind hits her body, she also enjoys watching the wind envelope form around her.
#### Internal
Ingénue really takes care of her wing arms. She wraps them up because she hates when they get caught on surfaces or drag across the floor. While she’ll let the rest of her body just go with the flow, she’s very careful about controlling her wing arms.

She could collapse herself into a smaller but more dense form. But she thinks people underestimate her because she’s a big fat nosy reporter. She relies on this image so she can get under people’s skins.
### Mental - How does she solve problems
#### External
Ingénue finds the most knowledgeable person in the room and begins asking probing questions. She gets a good scan of the room to sense the motives of people, so she can pinpoint the leader.

Once she has her answers and a good story, good report and a good byline she whispers the report off to make sure others know.
#### Internal
She usually acts docile or lets her unflattering form disarm people before she turns up the aggression. She’s not here to be polite, she’s here to get answers. By upsetting her subjects and making them uncomfortable, she’s able to get answers.
### Ethics - What is her opinion of right and wrong
#### External
Her Commune dedicates itself to spreading news and information. They instilled in her the value of the truth and the dangers of lying. She’s seen how minor lies can snowball out of control. She’s seen how lies meant to protect from the truth can backfire. Lying or hiding the truth suppresses information, and she really hates that.
#### Internal
She wants the truth to be free. “Why?” is her overwhelming question. She needs to understand why people do things. Ingénue believes people are best with the truth, even if they don’t like it or they “aren’t ready for it.” She doesn’t mind taking the blame if she can get the scoop.

# Opinions of other characters
## Torrin
How does she choose who to save? So much power and responsibility at her fingertips. I’m jealous.
## Teros and Quill - a human wingarm?
She is fascinated by how Teros uses Quill. Is it similar to her wingarms? It’s not, since Quill is an independent creature who is loyal.
## Vale - gatekeeper of the truth or to safety?
She forced us to trade knowledge for safety. She locked us in a cage. Why? I don’t trust her.
Vale raised a great sandstorm around Godsfont to protect the djinn from the outside world. Yet The Journalist finds it as a barrier to the outside world- what is out there? She wants Vale to either lower the wall or explain the War of Man in more detail- both ideas anger Vale.
## Blued - insight into living psyche
The Journalist realizes Blued studies human behavior like she does, and she encourages Blued to learn journalism and record her stories.
## Mek - Unimpressive Hotshot
He showboats and flirts, but Mek is a merchant of war. A few years of desperate heroism won’t make up for the atrocities he’s allowed. How dare he accuse me of destroying families and communities with the truth.
Mek’s armor is overcompensating for something. He showboats too much. And where did he get the resources for that, anyway?
# Physical Silhouette
She’s bulbous compared to others, with a large girthy belly and a long scarf behind her.

# Personality Generator
## Tarot Card Reading
### 15. Devil
She loves journalism and revealing the truth, even if people aren’t ready for it. She was born after Vale created the Great Sandstorm, and she wishes to report the world beyond the walls, despite the warnings about them. Doesn’t matter. The scoop is all that matters, even if she is in danger.
### 9. Hermit
She’s quick to point out other people’s behaviors and faults, but never her own. Her flaws are insignificant and negligible. At least that’s what she thinks. At some point she should stop and take a look at her own behaviors.
### 8. Strength
She is absolutely fearless in her pursuit of new behaviors and discoveries. She hides any crippling fear behind her urge to reveal the truth. She’s also upset when people try to hide the truth from her- that just makes her more determined.

# Seven Sins and Virtue challenge
## Sloth vs Diligence
Despite her diligence in finding news, she is a bit apathetic towards their plight, and has glory hog tendencies. For example, she would record the plight of a starving camp, but would make no effort to direct them to food or supplies unless asked. Ultimately she finds herself a recorder of history, and not an agent of change.

She has to learn when it’s worth trying to help. Maybe spreading awareness could lead to change in some way.
