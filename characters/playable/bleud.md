# Story
The Original Teros wanted demons who could infiltrate Godsfont. With Torrin’s control over water and life he began crafting humanoids who could think, talk and manipulate. Bleud was his prototype. She had the correct shape but she had many pigmentation errors. Teros determined she was a failure and cast her aside. A “gift” to the Water Tyrant.
Sealed within a chamber, Bleud was unable to move but she could think. And she felt Torrin’s thoughts and reached out to her. Torrin guided her to have a sense of will and belief. Bleud felt bound by her master’s orders, but she began manipulating them and gaining some leeway in twisting the rules.
Torrin finds Teros and Surge and asks them to help her save Bleud. Her knowledge of the Water Tyrant’s Palace is invaluable.

# Personality
## Traits
### Quiet Hedon
In Human or Djinn societies, Bleud can amass a following rather quickly, and have them attend to her every need. She loves massages and getting fed water.

### Blunt
Bleud’s natural charm lets her be honest in many situations. She tells people what they need to hear, even if they don’t want to hear it.

### Restrained/Incomplete
Bound by her masters and knowing she is artificial, Bleud continues to seek a way to be free of her masters and actually independent. To aid this goal she seeks research from wise wizards and artificers.

## Tarot Card Challenge
### 8.  Strength
Blued endures the mental struggle of her master and the urge to help her new master. It’s difficult for her to subvert every command, but she plays a long term mental game. She knows her life is temporary either way.
### 10. Wheel of Fortune
Blued enjoys help and physical pleasure from others. But spiritual help and advice is difficult for her to accept. She’s not used to getting help or respect, so when someone treats her nicely without her prompts, it feels strange and discomforting to her.
### 14. Temperance
Moderation is difficult. Blued is a hedonistic manipulator, and she was made to quickly burrow her way into societies and become a spy. She follows her orders and does a good job. How does she subvert her own orders?
## Seven Deadly Sins Flaw
### 6. Envy vs Gratitude
Despite all of her debauchery, Blued knows she is Incomplete, and it gnaws at her.

Especially Teros, who she knows is also Incomplete, yet he has greater autonomy and doesn’t even know he is following orders.
