# Tutorial ideas
## Advanced mission with the team
Teros, Torrin, Vale and Surge all investigate a temple to demonstrate basic mechanics.

- Teros can solo for a few rounds to show how to move and attack.
- Torrin can demonstrate an aura.
- Vale can show Area of Effect attacks.
- Surge can give an extra round.

Need to make it easy to understand and not stifle the user with too many mechanics. Maybe enough to get Teros and Vale to Godsfont.
