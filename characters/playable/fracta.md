# Fracta
Clings to her nostalgia tinted past
Alias is The Fractured Bandit Queen.

Fracta is in a tough spot, but her past was also awful. She’s too focused on the good parts of her past to acknowledge the bad ones.
# Story
Fracta formed the Fractal Bandits as a means to survive. Her grandfather worked to death in Godsfont, and her father died in Godsfont’s prison. She was careful not to raise the ire of Godsfont by carefully choosing less violent criminals, choosing targets who can afford to lose it, and quelling the more violent bandits.

Barubary soon infiltrated the camp and caused a schism within her camp. To earn his favor, Fracta takes up his offer to find a mage named Teros and his unique treasure.

Teros and Vale defeat Fracta, and she captures Godsfont’s residents in exchange for Teros. But Fracta’s Bandits abandon her and she has to fight them. Teros conscripts her to fight the bandits and she realizes that his Godsfont Guard is nowhere as awful as the previous ones.
# Dream
Her father alive and fully recovered, he bequeaths the united Fractal Bandits to Fracta. She leads the forces to one successful raid after another, spreading word of the Godsfont abuses. The clans and tribes unite under her command, and she surrounds Godsfont with overwhelming force. She prepares to lead the final assault and claim her greatest target.

# Personality
## Fracta’s masks
### Physical
#### External
Fracta is made of brown stone, bulky and tall. She wears an iron bandana and above that lies brightly colored rocks one would consider hair. Her axe is rough, with a gray handle holding raw iron ore.
#### Internal
Fracta likes to sink her feet into the sand and other soft minerals, to feel them better. One of her favorite pastimes is to detect metal using her feet and guess its depth.

The ore in the axe and the bandana are reminders from her previous leader. Mementos before the clash with another bandit group got him killed and Fracta hailed a hero.
### Mental
#### External
Fracta has no formal training- when she wasn’t stealing, she paid traveling scholars for their aid. She did learn about trade routes, wandering nomads, and the lesser known hideaways of the desert. Perfect for setting up ambushes, setting up camps and evading patrol.

Her former leader taught her the ropes, warned her about treachery, and gave her the hunk of iron as a gift. Pragmatism is important.
#### Internal
Fracta considers geographical factors when solving issues. Meet people in canyons and cul de sacs with no easy escape. Can she trigger a landslide if the deal goes bad? Can she cause sinkholes to trap carriages so her marks cannot escape?
### Spiritual
#### External
Her former leader taught Fracta that there is no honor among thieves. Everyone is out for themselves. He also taught her to work slowly towards her goals. No one will care about a small, petty theft. But guards will go berserk if you execute brazen theft. Keep it simple and no one will notice.
#### Internal
Fracta learned a long time ago about the War of Man, and she’s learned to ultimately trust no one but herself. There were a few she could count on to help her in times of trouble. But eventually they either died in her name, abandoned the camp or tried to usurp power and she had to put them down.

The only thing she can rely on is gold and material wealth. It can’t betray her.
