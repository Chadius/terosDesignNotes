# Lini
Buries her past good and bad
Lini is proud of her future as the Heirophant’s daughter. But she can’t escape her thieving past, and she hides behind her faith instead of reconciling them.
Lini is a Fire Djinn, about 49 years old.
# Story
Lini was a fire djinn who was sold into a bandit camp. She yearned for freedom and sought the ways of Hiras, the goddess of freedom, joy and passion. The man who would become Hierophant adopted her, and she joined the Godsfont Guard as penance for her past. A demon attacked and poisoned her one night, spurring Teros into helping her as well as his kidnapped family.
Teros returns a year later, reviving Lini. She continues her duties as a Godsfont Guard, protecting the town and paying off her life debt to Teros.
# Nightmare
Lini wanders the Calm Plains. A vast land where the souls of the afterlife await their fate. The gods choose the strongest, the most pious who follow their morals. Lini continues to wander, rejected by good and evil gods. The sins of her life as a thief weigh heavily upon her, and she believes the gods will never forgive her. But her redemption attempt was enough to anger the gods of trickery, and now she wanders forever.

# What does Lini look like?
Somewhere between loosely-dressed sun worshipper and exciting dancer, Lini’s black hair rises and wavers. Her skin is a dull red, and she wears loose clothing.

Lini’s dress has several loose layers of cloth held by a golden belt. Her top has two straps around her shoulders. She’s barefoot here, and her black hair is held by a headband.

## Physical Silhouette
Her head should look like a torch. Her hair is wavy and points away from her forehead. Her loose clothing looks similar to a ringed torch.

## Music Inspiration
Street Fighter V – Theme of Rashid
His theme feels like the sun, piercing the night. Lini dances as she holds her staff high, its healing light washing away her friends’ fear and weakness.

## Tarot Card challenge
### 18. The Moon
Lini’s life as a bandit still bothers her. She did it to survive and escape punishment, but she never forgave herself for stealing from others. She remembers the joy of possession and it frightens her. Her brush with death has resurrected these fears. Will she die burdened with sin? Or will her life as the Hierophant's daughter make amends?
### 14. Temperance
Lini strives to balance the needs of many when negotiating. She wants everyone to have something, and carries a deep empathy during negotiations. People turn to her for guidance when the Hierophant isn’t around. It makes her a bit stubborn and obsessed when she can’t get people to reconcile, though.
### 10. Wheel of Fortune
Lini’s life comes in ebbs and flows, She knows when times are good, bad times are approaching. But she never gives up hope, because it’s only a matter of time before life improves. She’s optimistic in nature, sometimes to an annoying degree. But that optimism kept her alive when she was a thief.
## Seven Deadly Sins Flaw
### 3. Greed vs Charity (or Generosity)
Lini loves praise. She’ll do whatever it takes to get your approval, even at cost to herself. She claims she’s selfless, but really she just wants to be the center of attention.

Lini loves to help, but is it because she’s generous? Or is she a glory hound?
