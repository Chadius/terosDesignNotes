# Vale: The Atoner

# History
To the race of Man, Vale is a legendary hero. Wielding the mighty Dragonbreath spell, she destroyed armies and protected Man from other creatures. She was one of the legendary heroes who helped in the War of Man.

To otherworldly races, Vale is a powerful general who decimated their armies and left the homeland unprotected against Man. Mankind soon conquered, subjugated and eliminated them as Mankind spread throughout the world.

Vale considers her actions in the War of Man to be her greatest mistake. Mankind needed her help against other races but she went too far in her bid for power. She was considered the world’s greatest mage and she was entrusted with great arcane feats she performed with ease. But one day she realized she was just a killer. All of that power and all she could do was destroy civilizations.

So Vale fled from her post, abandoning most of her artifacts. She found a village near a desert oasis where Mankind and Djinn refused to fight and instead chose to coexist. As a way to atone, she conjured storm walls to keep invaders out and used her destructive magic to excavate and demolish so it was easy for the town to rebuild and clean itself. She taught the people of her knowledge and they were thankful. She never assumed a role or position of power, even though the people loved her.
## History (ALT)
Vale came to Godsfont 423 years ago, seeking solitude and atonement. During the War of Man, she was considered the world’s greatest mage. But one day she realized she was just a killer. All of that power and all she could do was destroy civilizations. She fled and exiled herself to the desert village of Godsfont, only to learn Mankind and Djinn managed to coexist.

She chose to use her destructive magic to help and protect, so she conjured storm walls to keep invaders out and used her destructive magic to excavate and demolish so it was easy for Godsfont to grow. Godsfont was thankful but her display of power was still fearful.

Rumor had it that an arch mage breached the barrier and was searching for her. So Vale confronted Teros, a young arch mage who was also sick of war. He wanted to seek out her friendship and learn a thing or two. She became his mentor and finally found a friend. When Teros became a father, he asked Vale to become his son’s guardian, a role she accepted out of friendship.

Teros and his family disappeared one day, and Vale was regretful she still couldn’t protect her closest allies with her magic. It took her a year to learn enough divination magic to locate Teros. She bolts from her laboratory to rescue him and protect him and the town that loves him so much.

# Personality
## The Lie to Correct
You can learn too much learning.

## Tarot Card Challenge
### 2 - High Priestess
Vale gets worked up on material matters too much. Wild rumors about her cause her to overthink her impact on the world, and she often has to leave and seek refuge and silence for herself. Vale often needs peace and quiet, and will sequester herself from all but her closest allies.

### 13 - Death
Vale’s had to significantly change her life and abandon most of her possessions in order to grow. She keeps her belongings lean, just in case she has to abandon it again. Wealth means nothing if you don’t enjoy what you can spend it on.

### 22 - The World
Vale has trouble letting go of her past. The djinn and Godsfont serve as her chance to atone- if she can protect the humans and djinn, then she will be satisfied. Her hatred of her past self blinds her to her many accomplishments and the speed at which she learned magic. But most of her magic is destructive in nature- if only she could use other methods...

## Seven Deadly Sins Challenge
### 6. Greed vs Charity (or Generosity)
War generals, bored elites and power hungry wizards kept Vale under control by offering her access to more destructive magic and spells. She would take their offer without a second thought, dismiss most of the magic as too weak, and then add it to her archives. Her library was filled with magic spells she kept but never used. She just liked to stockpile spells.

Female. 
I'm 74 years old.
Looking for men.
The nation pays my living expenses.

I'm the Archmage. I don't suffer fools.

I like the opera. Have you ever heard singers yell? Loudly, yet controlled.
We can hear her words all the way from the booth. Crafting your voice like 
that takes a lot of knowledge and control.

The sunrise is so beautiful. I'm looking for someone to wake up with,
every morning. Someone who appreciates the quiet moments in life.
It's loud enough for me on the front lines, I'd like some quiet moments, please.

And for those who know some magic? Stuff it. I was weaving fireballs 
when you were in your introductory class. It's nice to not talk shop
all the time, you know?

My manor used to belong to Lord Graemer, a holy man rotten to the core.
Got it extra cheap. Haven't seen a ghost in decades.
Plenty of room, too. Be nice to the staff, thank you.

## Vale's Thirst-induced Nightmare
Vale finds herself in a library, full of books to teach herself new magic types beyond destructive magic. But she’s smart enough to realize the books are worthless – fully of hoonswaggle and follbazzle nonsense. The theories don’t make sense, either. She knows she’s trapped in a dream full of lies and she  doesn’t know how to escape – psychic magic and dream theory were never her strong suits.

She still abuses the transmutation magic though – may as well relive her youth with her elder brain. No back pains and a big butt.
## Vale’s Layers

#### External
Older woman who carries her favorite cane even though she doesn’t need it.
Wears light robes. 
Her belt is tied around her waist with a small sash.

Vale is vain, even in her old age. She was quite the looker when she was young.
She does miss her firm butt.

Vale's cane is the first magic staff she ever made.
It’s her first major accomplishment.
### Mental - How does she solve problems
#### External
During her rise to Archmage, Vale learned powerful magic for war. Her strategies involved destroying powerful opponents and large armies.
#### Internal
Vale tries not to use her magical might right off the bat, especially when a nonviolent solution could be applied. She will study and apply magic theory to problems to understand how they work and how they can be dismantled.
### Ethics - What is her opinion of right and wrong
#### External
She is thanked for destroying enemies.
But those enemies consider her a monster.
#### Internal
Every drop of blood spilled is one life that could have been saved.
Hard work is its own reward. She had to learn her destructive magics before she could control them, and she’ll learn how to find less destructive uses of magic.

Magic was all too easy for Vale. It came too easily for her, lightning and flame magic was easy. That's why she was the archmage.

But she never understood healing magic. Too many layers. Too many unexpected surprises. Non destructive magic was never her forte. Too much to learn before she could show anything for it.

Vale realized she had all the time in the world to figure it out. May as well take it slow. She didn't have to master all magic. Now releived, Vale spent time on building a permanent home.

- Teros chooses to hide his shame and suffer suspicion.
- Vale holds onto a false hope, defying logic.
- Surge loses faith in Vale and distrusts Teros more.

"Vale, there you are." Surge approaches like a dog glad to see his master. As he turns the corner, he barely conceals his fangs. "Teros." Strategy had given way to an awkward pause.

"Surge, Teros and I were discussing tomorrow's raid. Come on." She waves the Undine over to the map. "Most of our troop will serve as a distraction. Draw the weaklings out. Our target is the leader, Korsin and his benefactor. Fracta said we take them out, she can retake control of the bandits and order them to surrender." She looks to Teros, he nods. She looks to Surge and his distaste is obvious to them both.

"R-right. How do we know they won't have a reserve troop?" Surge looks Teros right in the eye. "How do we know you haven't given us away? Maybe they're lying in ambush, right outside the camp." Quill forms into a shocked expression before hovering between the two.

Teros gently moves Quill aside. "Surge, my goal is to rescue the people they kidnapped. You know this. The easiest way is to disrupt their chain of command so we can secure the hostages in the ensuing chaos." His words slow, calculated for logic, ignorant of Surge's true questions. "And I am the Captain. Why would I jeopardize the mission?"

Surge's eyes scan over to Vale's. Her eyes are on the floor. "Vale, did you ever finish the analysis?" She looks up at him *not now*. He looks to Teros. "When you... rescued me from Barubary, you bled. I asked Vale to analyze your blood. I don't know who you are, exactly, but-"

Vale taps the ground with her wooden cane. "Okay Surge. The results were... inconclusive." Both look at her, she isn't looking back. "That's not true. The blood was a perfect match. Like he hadn't aged a day since we drew it last time." She keeps her gaze on the walls. Surge knew his Guardian all his life; she was hiding her suspicions with her trademark pacing routine. "So... it's him. It's Teros."

Surge sighed. "The last 2 people I met who claimed to be Teros were very manipulative. They relied on magic to twist my mind into compliance. They failed because they looked like him, but they couldn't act like him." He looks through Teros.

Teros cleared his throat. "Once again, I am sorry they targeted you like that. But I am him." *I must be him.* "I am Teros. Vale never told me about the blood test, how could I fake that?" Teros lifts the weight of his lies. Too many lives will be crushed underneath its weight.

"...Very well. I will travel with you if you want to the bandit camp." Surge turns away from the lies. "Good night, Vale." Surge moves away from his trust. This thing got to Vale, his Guardian. Maybe she was tired of searching. Maybe she was tired of failure. Maybe she didn't take his stories for granted. But Surge would not let anyone get to him again.
