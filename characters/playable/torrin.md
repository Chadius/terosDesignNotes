# Torrin
# The Lie to Correct
The desert must acknowledge I will never become a Tyrant.
The desert must accept me for what I am, not what I could be.
# Story
Torrin is a rare Water Djinn – one simply conjures out of the riverbed. Water Djinn are feared and maintaining an appealing form is difficult, so she chose to live alone and present herself when necessary.
Virton’s War Front fought a demon invasion and sought out her help. They didn’t care about her form but they did appeal to her sense of goodness. She gained an interest in Virton, Champion of Justice, and used his powers to bless the riverbed surrounding the valley of the demons, weakening them enough for one final push. Torrin found a higher calling and she found acceptance within the armed forces. As the war ended and later generations became more civilian, Torrin found fear and prejudice return. She continued her vigilance over the desert, mostly alone.
Virton’s War Front, now renamed Godsfont, was home to two new mages. She befriended Vale, and the human introduced her to Teros. He accepted her – the real her, and urged her to feel natural around him. She fell in love and they formed a couple, giving birth to a son Surge and making Vale his Guardian.
Kidnapped, Torrin felt the corruption flow through her. The demons were not dead, and they wanted her power for their own. She lost most of her body as she escaped, and by the time she recovered her body had a mind of its own – a new Water Tyrant, tarnishing her name and form.
She seeks a way to stop the Water Tyrant from ruining more lives. She realizes Teros is in grave danger and seeks to help him, even if he is also incomplete.
# Personality
## Torrin’s masks
### Physical
#### External
As a water djinn, Torrin doesn’t have feet, just thick watery stumps used to keep her upright. She also has very wide hips, compared to a human. She is essentially an upright geyser, which requires a lot of willpower and force to hold.

What little decorations she can afford holds many motifs to the various cultures she’s seen rise and fall, as well as the symbol of Virton prominently on the back.

Water Djinn are almost monstrous in appearance, as they lack many features and move in inhuman manners. The split left her lanky and bulbous.
#### Internal
Torrin finds her body, her identity stolen, and it upsets her deeply. She worked hard to cultivate it, and now people look down at her like a monster.
### Mental
#### External
Torrin was gifted knowledge of the lands, and was able to trade education in exchange for protection. Eventually the Crusaders of Virton taught her the word of Virton and she quickly learned more.
#### Internal
Trust is the most important commodity available. Torrin will help people to earn their trust, and in exchange she wants them to trust her. Sometimes she cannot explain her suggestions, but she asks people to believe in her and Virton.
### Spiritual
#### External
When she felt lost during the War of Man, she turned to the gods for help, and Virton answered. She was told Mankind’s zeal to survive made itself blind to good people, regardless of their origin.
#### Internal
Torrin decided that she must serve as an example for everyone to follow. She would recite the good word and follow it to the best of her ability. She invested herself spiritually, trying to remain emotionless and unattached.

# Opinions vs Player Characters
## Vale
Vale doesn’t recognize her powers as gifts, even when they can be used to clear obstructions. She forgets when she cleared rubble to quickly rescue children buried in rubble, or her early irrigation efforts to clear the earth and laid foundations for buildings.

## Tarot Card Challenge
Torrin and Corrupted Torrin share the same cards, but Corrupted Torrin is reversed.
### 18. The Moon (Upright)
Torrin focuses on honing her intuition and listening to the divine word to drive her philosophy. She wondered if the moon was her true source of guidance, but she learned to not worry about it and simply move on.
### 21. The World (Reversed)
Torrin’s goal to destroy demons hit a significant roadblock as her maturity was stolen. She seeks a way to reassert her identity upon a world that no longer recognizes her and treats her as a child.
### 0. The Fool (Upright)
Torrin has to admit this is a new lease on life. She has another chance to correct the many mistakes she made growing up. She has a chance to bond with people who thought she was too sacred to interact with.
## Seven deadly sins flaw
### 2. Gluttony vs Temperance
Torrin sees the opportunity to indulge in her desires, but rejects it. As the famed hero she quietly calls upon favors when needed. She knows it is all too easy to use her glory as a crutch.
