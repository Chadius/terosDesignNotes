# Mek
Delusions of Grandeur
He lives as a great hero, fighting bandits and the greedy with his power. He never stops to see if his actions are paying off, or if he’s on a power trip.
## Personality
Cocky, full of himself. Does not share. Arbiter of right and wrong.
“I’ve privatized world peace”
# The Lie to Correct
I fight to survive, and to protect. I would like some thanks.
If I’m not thanked, did I really help them?
# Story
Mek was a weapons merchant who fell prey to banditry. He built an impressive suit of armor to escape. He began fighting bandits as he could, using his own weapons. After that he blazed a path out of there and began tinkering on his armor, improving it to the best of his abilities.
Mek indulges on his fantasies – get his revenge on bandits, receive adoration of his loving fans, and make money selling his smithing abilities. He even sells his leftover weapons and armor for defense, of course. The money is too good and the fame is irresistible – is he resuming his merchant of war persona?
Mek meets the Fractal Bandits as they begin hauling kidnapped Godsfont citizens across the desert. He heedlessly rushes into danger to rescue them.

# Personality
## Mek’s Masks
### Physical
### External
He works on his goatee and mustache and exercises to stay in shape and keep his bodyfat low.
He also works on his armor, making sure it shines against the sunlight (although that makes him a target.)

- Mek works out to improve his physique, but also to project strength.
### Internal
Mek takes a lot of pride in looking good. When you look good, you feel good.
He is always thinking about maintaining his armor, akin to cleaning a fancy luxury item. He wants to show off his wealth and power.

- Mek wants innocents to thank him and enemies to fear him.
## Mental
### External
He learned a lot from the highest-paid scholars and teachers his parents could afford, and was taught to think outside the box. From maintaining fuel levels in his armor, to balancing the magical reservoirs for his fire attacks, he knows how to tweak his equipment.
He also knows who to hire to get the job done. Everyone has a price.

- Morals can be bought. He learned that from his captors and the guards who fled rather than protect him.
### Internal
Mek thinks money can solve every problem. With enough money, he can buy the tools, ingredients and instruction to break his limits.

- Mek never wants to feel helpless again, and overcompensates with wealth. He would rather purchase wantonly than confront his fear.
## Spiritual
### External
Mek was taught to take advantage of situations. Even if it seemed immoral, someone else would take advantage anyway, it may as well be him.

- Mek has to deal with the pain of being a prisoner. He doesn't want anyone to experience it and focuses on saving them, even at extreme risk to himself.
### Internal
Mek considers laws to be a suggestion. Physical laws can be broken with enough mechanical force. Magical limits are just ideas, bound by inadequate understanding. And in either case, money makes morals very flexible, to the point where people will help him break these rules.

- He focuses on rescue because its his way of fighting back against the pain of being a prisoner.
# Looks
Give a scorpion motif. The Stinging Scorpion or something like that.
He thinks he’s a self-made super hero. He’s clad in iron with flame jets helping him fly.
