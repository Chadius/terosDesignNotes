# Teros
The Main character is a clone of the original wandering wizard. Unlike the original, he wasn't corrupted with demonic power
and continues to protect the village of Godsfont as the Captain of the Guard.
He also has impostor syndrome as he's worried people will discover he is not Human
but rather a Simulacrum of a Human.

## Backstory
### Early life
- Born into poverty
- Sold to a drunk mage who recognized his innate magic
- Read the mage's books and taught himself to survive
- Created Quill, his familiar companion
- Recognized by Imperial Magic Scholars, recruited into school
### Friendship and Rise to Archmage
- Specialized in transportation and dimensional magic
- Rose to top of class
- Joined military as payment for his free tuition
- Rose through the ranks; known for his tactical skill

### The Sojourn
With his family missing and Lini poisoned, Teros decided to pause his time as Captain
so he could focus on rescuing his family and finding the cure to Lini's poison.

Gloria became the interim Captain while he began research. He found a promising lead:
the Night Lotus, an extremely rare plant. Its restorative properties were so powerful
it was nearly hunted to extinction. Teros wishes everyone goodbye and sets off to collect it.

As he reaches the plant, he comes to a stop as his programming takes over.
Leave Godsfont for a year and destabilize the city. The town would be hit hard without
his guidance, giving the enemy plenty of time to steal and destroy it.

## Gameplay
### Team Role
#### Transporter
Teros uses his dimensional magic to quickly travel around the area.
He moves faster than most humans, and he can teleport himself short distances.
Eventually he can bring people to him, either rescuing them or warping them ahead.

#### Assaulter
Teros has strong physical and magical attacks.
- He is trained to use a spear
- His connection with Quill gives him magical portals and dimensional blasts.

Eventually he can learn to counter with magic and AoE with his spear.
Most magic cannot counter, and most physicals are single target.

## Teros's Masks
Did you know Terios means Mirror in Greek? I didn’t until afterwards. (July 7, 2020)

### Physical
#### External
Like Teros, he is a dark skinned man of average build who wears green robes. 
He crafted a companion of pure magic and he calls it Quill.  
His movement is careful and controlled, using magic to propel him short distances.

#### Internal
Teros likes his cowl on as a sign of fashion and pride.
He keeps his body fit, but not muscular.
He tries not to stray too far from what the Original Teros was.
Terrified his physical form will betray him if he strays too far.

### Mental
#### External
Teros was trained to be a warmage.
He learned how to blend physical and magical skills alongside war tactics and strategy.
In his career as Archmage, he fought in multiple battles and wars, picking up information along the way.

#### Internal
Teros is quick with analysis, but he tries to get input from his nearby peers and allies.
Sometimes they have a piece of information or an idea he had not considered.
He learned that war is a team effort - the outliers are the easiest to remove.

### Spiritual
#### External
The original Teros simply followed his master’s orders when he was young. He believed in intelligence as the ultimate equalizer: a poor man was rich while a rich fool would soon become poor.

The new Teros was directed to simply help his allies and follow his master’s orders. 
As Teros wore the mask and began to realize he was the mask, the Impostor Syndrome sank in.

#### Internal
He does things because his original personality did what was right,
but ALSO because he wanted to earn their approval. Getting ousted for identity frightened him.

# Tarot card challenge
Teros and Corrupted Teros have the same tarot cards, in the same direction.

## 8. Justice
Justice Reversed: Inner Critic

Teros constantly questions his struggle about the value of knowledge. He constantly questions the true value of knowledge, and how much emphasis he places on it. Is it the end all, be all? Is it sometimes better to work on instinct? Is too much information a bad thing?
## 3. Empress
Upright: Creativity

Teros has tried to branch beyond laws and information, hoping to use his creativity to help him be more innovative.

He thanks his calligraphy hobby for his rise to the rank of Mage General. It inspired him to think about ways to invent new spells and break the rules in various ways. He was a bit controversial for wasting time in the arts rather than planning war strategy, but it sped up the meetings immensely.

Quill is a unique familiar he crafted, and he uses ink as his motif.
## 21. The World
Reversed: Losing sight of the goal

The cloned Teros was made with incomplete goals - he has no memory of his family. He finds his friends and rebuilds the Godsfont Guard, he finds purpose again. But as he realizes his origin he wonders about his purpose - to protect the town, defeat the corrupted, or retain knowledge.

# Seven Deadly Sins flaw:
## 4. Sloth vs Diligence
Teros questions his search for more knowledge- is he learning for learning’s sake? Are there topics he could learn more about but he’s dismissed them out of hand?

Teros fights a mission between being efficient and wasting his free time.

## 2021-11-01
- Teros wanders on a walk
- Puts feelings together "Who am I?"
- Maybe he should suppress?
- But he thirsts for more knowledge
- Too scared to revel but driven to help

Silence comforts him, while footsteps irritate him. Teros stops long enough to reinvite silence. The sun is always welcome, even as it retreats below the horizon. Maybe celestial bodies are afraid.

Godsfont thanked him for service yesterday. The earth djinn was unstable, angry. Claimed he was underpaid. He probably was; the merchant was quite rude. But violence begets violence. Hopefully his time in jail will calm him down.

"Is this who I am?" Teros looks at his hands. Are these even his hands? He takes off his gloves and observes the grooves in his palms. No scars. He remembers the failed days trying to form Quill. It backfired so many times. Now his hands are too clean- when did he heal?

After breaking up a gang of Ardons, Vale came to congratulate him. "Hey Teros, good job. Took you a little longer than I thought." She paused for a moment. Long enough to begin analyzing him. It was her habit of scanning too much. But she never made a move.

Teros was too perfect for his own good. Small scars, alchemical burns, injuries from cutting himself off in incomplete portals- all gone. Vale was suspicious. She must have figured it out. Why didn't she say anything? He recalled his response: "Just trying to keep the peace."

Teros sat down and let the cool air blow over him. It would be so easy to stay. It wraps over him like a blanket. Covers his legs, tucks in his arms. The sun is gone. Bedtime.

A firefly bothers him. A bright red firefly buzzes near his ear. It's Quill. He snaps his eyes open. It tells him Vale's words: "Well, you could do better."

He stands up. "I have to do better. I have to know." The gloves hide his shame. He looks up to Quill. "I have to know more." The wind pushes him back to Godsfont. Away from rest.
