# Teros
The Main character is a clone of the original wandering wizard. Unlike the original, he wasn't corrupted with demonic power
and continues to protect the village of Godsfont as the Captain of the Guard.
He also has impostor syndrome as he's worried people will discover he is not Human
but rather a Simulacrum of a Human.

### The Sojourn
With his family missing and Lini poisoned, Teros decided to pause his time as Captain
so he could focus on rescuing his family and finding the cure to Lini's poison.

Gloria became the interim Captain while he began research. He found a promising lead:
the Night Lotus, an extremely rare plant. Its restorative properties were so powerful
it was nearly hunted to extinction. Teros wishes everyone goodbye and sets off to collect it.

As he reaches the plant, he comes to a stop as his programming takes over.
Leave Godsfont for a year and destabilize the city. The town would be hit hard without
his guidance, giving the enemy plenty of time to steal and destroy it.
